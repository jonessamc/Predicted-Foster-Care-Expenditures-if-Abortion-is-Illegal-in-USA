Predicted Foster Care Expenditures if Abortion is Illegal in the United States
Samantha Gildner, 2019


I. Introduction

The hypothesis of this project is the child foster care systemâ€™s expenditures in the United States would significantly increase 
if abortion services were illegal resulting in more children in the foster care system. Secondary goals include analyzing current 
children foster care spending per state, foster care spending per child, estimating future expenditures of children foster care system 
without adding another variable, and estimating future expenditures if abortion services were illegal and resulted in an increased number 
of children in the foster care system.


II. Data Sets and Resources

CDCs Abortion Surveillance System-Center for Disease and Control and Prevention. For this analysis, data from 2011, 2013, and 2015 was 
utilized in CSV download. Data indicates how many abortion services were provided per state. Most current data available from this source 
is from 2015. https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm

Kids Count Data Center- The Annie E. Casey Foundation. For this analysis, data was extracted from data table in excel format. Data 
indicates how many children are in the foster care system by state and nationally. This data is available for years 2008-2017 however for 
the purpose of this project 2011, 2013, 2015 were utilized. Kids Count Data Center includes any child who is receiving assistance from 
federal, state, or local child welfare services.

Child Welfare Financing Survey SFY 2016- Child Trends. For this analysis, data from 2016 was used as data is only available for years 
2016, 2014, 2012 ongoingly. Data available for abortion service totals is available on alternating years. Using the most recent 2016 data
from Child Welfare Financing Survey for this project. Child Welfare Financing Survey totals includes financing from federal, state, and 
local sources and funding for programs and services such as ensuring safety, achieving permanency, and strengthening families.

V. Discussion

Based on the plots and analysis of total expenditures by state (Figure B) and number of children in foster care by state (Figure A), 
total expenditures in some states are not equivalent to the number of children in the foster care system. In addition, state spending on
children in Foster care differs from state to state. Please see Figure C.

Total number of abortion services differ significantly from state to state (Figure D). Total number of abortion services is significantly
higher in some states compared to others. 

Although not included in this analysis, population by state data may provide further insight to the hypothesis of this paper and total 
amount spent on a child in foster care by state (Figure C). 


VI. Conclusion
There would be a significant increase in total child foster care expenditures if abortion services were illegal resulting in an increased number of children in foster care (Figure G). Compare Figure G to Figure F for reference.

We are aware that there are biases in the data. Data analyzed is the current data available to the public on these subjects. Further 
examination of this data is still in process.
